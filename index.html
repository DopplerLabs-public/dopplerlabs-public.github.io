          Four years ago we started Doppler Labs with a mission to build a computer for the ears. We set out to change the way we interact with technology, enhance how people experience sound, and help people hear better.<br>
          <br>
          During that time we launched three products: DUBS Acoustic Filters, Here Active Listening, and Here One Wireless Smart Earbuds. We put together an incredible team and served an amazing community of customers who believed in our vision of a future, where voice, audio, and in-ear technology would create a new way of computing. We helped get the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act signed into law. And at our peak, we were 80 people, working together to achieve our mission. But we are sad to say that, despite our best efforts, we have reached a point where we have to wind down Doppler Labs.<br>
          <br>
          This is not because our vision of the future is not going to happen. We are actually more confident than ever that it will. Amazing hearing aids will be available at lower prices, and you will be able to tune them yourself. Tens of millions of people will be interacting with audio-based smart assistants, translating hundreds of languages instantaneously, and even going without their phones because smart earbuds will give them access to the people they love and the data they need. We wish we could have been the company to establish this future, but we know others will build on what we started, and we’ll be rooting them on.<br>
          <br>
          So what happened? To put it simply, over the past months, we took hundreds of meetings in an attempt to secure the necessary capital to continue running our business and build our next product – which would have been a true alternative to traditional hearing aids. However, we couldn’t find the needed capital to develop another complex hardware product.<br>
          <br>
          So what’s next? Over the past several months, we’ve been developing a new version of the Here One app and an accompanying hearing service, designed specifically to help those who need to hear better - especially in noisy environments - but don’t want to buy a hearing aid due to cost or social stigma. We weren’t able to put the finishing touches on this new app – called Here Plus – and formally launch it in December, but we’re making it available for download from the Apple App Store so all Here One customers can download it and experience our final effort as a company, for free.<br>
          <br>
          We are deeply grateful that we were given the opportunity to take a shot at our mission. We want to thank all of our customers, fans, investors, partners, and colleagues – from DUBS, Here Active Listening, and Here One – who believed in us, shared their stories, and helped us make it as far as we did.<br>
          <br>
          We got to serve and work with amazing people and learned immensely from the journey. Our hope now is that the legacy of what Doppler started lives on through other products and endeavors for years to come.<br>
