      <h2>
        Doppler Labs was founded with the mission to make computing more immersive and human
      </h2>
      <p>At a time when others were focused on technology for the eyes and the wrist, we decided to focus on a different platform: the ears. And Here One™ was born.</p>
      <p>Here One is the result of years of technological development, starting with the release of DUBS Acoustic Filters™ and followed by Here Active Listening™, which introduced the power to control real-world sound. This groundbreaking technology earned rave reviews from publications like TIME and WIRED. Here One builds on this technology at the core of Here Active Listening to create the first-ever wireless smart earbuds with Real-World Sound Control. Here One is our first step towards making computing more immersive and human.</p>
