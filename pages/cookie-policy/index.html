<h2><strong>What are cookies?</strong></h2>
<p>Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your browsing device (such as a computer or smartphone) when you visit a website.

<h2><strong>What are web beacons?</strong></h2>
<p>Some of our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes also called clear gifs or pixel tags).

This information is available to any website you visit. For example, we are able to use it to help us deliver cookies, count visits, prevent fraud and to tell if an email or advertisement has been opened and acted upon. In short, cookies work together with web beacons to accomplish the functions and purposes described herein.</p>
