<h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>WE DO NOT IN ANY WAY EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY FOR: (A) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY OUR NEGLIGENCE OR (B) FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION, OR EXCLUDE OR LIMIT ANY LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
<p>Because some states, territories, and/or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states, territories, and/or jurisdictions, the liability of Doppler and the Doppler affiliates shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Doppler and the Doppler Affiliates harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, damages, or other losses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from or arising out of your use of the Platform, your negligent or intentional misuse of the Products, or any breach or alleged breach by you of this Agreement.</p>

Headings are for convenience only and shall not be used to construe the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<h2>PART B - EU TERMS OF USE AND CONDITIONS OF SALE</h2>
<h2>1. Ordering Products</h2>
<p>You can place orders for Products with us by following the process outlined on our Sites. You acknowledge that by placing an order with us you will be under an obligation to pay for the Products in that order.</p>
<p>Our order process allows you to check and amend any errors before submitting your order to us. Please take the time to read and check your order at each stage of the order process.</p>
<p>All orders are subject to acceptance by us. We will send you an email to confirm acceptance. The contract for purchase between you and us will only be made when we send you this email to confirm acceptance. We will charge your chosen payment method after we accept your order. We will send a further email when your order has been dispatched.</p>
<p>If you change your mind about the Products you have ordered after making your order you may be able to return the Products to us in accordance with the Cancellation and Returns Policy below at section 9.</p>
<p>You must keep the contact details we hold for you up-to-date so that we can contact you if necessary about your order or the delivery of the Products.</p>
<h2>2. Availability</h2>
<p>All orders for Products are subject to the availability of those Products and the materials for making the Products. We will inform you as soon as possible after placing an order if, for any reason, the Products you have ordered are not available or are subject to any delay.</p>
<p>If we are unable to supply you with a Product, for example, because the manufacturer is out of stock or because of an error in the price, we will inform you of this by email and we will not process your order. If you have already paid for the Product we will refund you the full amount as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>3. Images and Sizing of Products</h2>
<p>The images of the Products on our Sites are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer will display the colours accurately or reflect the true colour of the Products. The Products that are delivered to you may therefore vary slightly from those images.</p>
<p>Although we have made every effort to be as accurate as possible, the measurements indicated including weights, dimensions and capacities shown on our Sites are approximate only.</p>
<h2>4. Prices of Products</h2>
<p>The price of any Product will be as quoted on our Sites, except in cases of obvious error.</p>
<p>The price of any Product may change from time to time, but changes will not affect any order we have accepted.</p>
<p>The price of a Product includes VAT (where it applies) but excludes delivery costs, which will be added to the total amount due. To see the relevant delivery charges for a product, please refer to our Shipping Policy.</p>
<p>It is always possible that some of the Products listed on our Sites may be incorrectly priced, despite our reasonable efforts. We will normally verify prices as part of our order-handling procedure so that, where a Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you. If the Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on our Sites, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of the rejection.</p>
<p>We are under no obligation to provide the Product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you an order acceptance, if the price displayed is a genuine and honest mistake and the error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognized by you as a mispricing.</p>
<h2>5. How to Pay</h2>
<p>We accept payment with the payment methods listed on our Sites. You must pay for the Products and any applicable delivery charges in advance.</p>
<p>By submitting an order to us through our Sites, you are confirming that the payment details provided on your order are valid and correct.</p>

<p>We hope you will be pleased with everything you have bought from us but if you are unhappy with your Products, you can return them to us in accordance with the returns policy described in this section.</p>
<h3>RIGHT TO CANCEL</h3>
<p>You have a legal right to cancel the contract between you and us within 14 days of delivery without giving a reason.</p>
<p>The full terms and conditions that apply to your right to cancel and the process for exercising your right to cancel are set out in our Cancellation and Returns Policy.</p>
<p>If you are entitled to reimbursement in accordance with our Cancellation and Returns Policy, we may withhold reimbursement until we have received the Products back or you have supplied evidence of having sent back the Products, whichever is the earliest.</p>
<p>You are only liable for any diminished value of the Products resulting from the unfair/unreasonable wear and tear of the Products which is not necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the Products. We may make a deduction from any reimbursement you are entitled to from us for such loss in value of any Products we supply.</p>
<h3>FAULTY OR MIS-DESCRIBED GOODS</h3>
<p>If you are returning the Products to us because they are faulty or mis-described, we will refund: the price of the Product in full; any applicable delivery charges, and any reasonable costs you incur in returning the item to us. As a consumer, you will always have legal rights in relation to Products that are faulty or not as described. These legal rights are not affected by our Cancellation and Returns Policy or these Terms of Use and Conditions of Sale.</p>
