          <p>Selectively tune into sounds you want to hear and reduce the sounds you don’t. Cancel out an airplane engine but still hear the flight attendant, reduce office chatter, amplify speech in a noisy restaurant, or find peace and quiet among a crowd.</p>
            <p>With three high powered mics in each of your Here Buds™, our Directional Speech Enhancement feature allows you to hear where sounds are coming from. Tune into speech in front or behind you. Let Here One do the listening for you in your conversations. </p>

      <h2><img src="/assets/accessibility_globalcitizen.jpg" alt="Global Citizen logo" width="240" /></h2>
      <p>Doppler Labs and Global Citizen partnered to launch #HereTogether, a movement aimed at bringing hearing health to the forefront of a global conversation. As technology, accessibility, attitudes, and culture have evolved, innovation in hearing health and the perception around assistive hearing technologies have remained painfully stagnant. The world cannot ignore this any longer, and it’s time to recognize the far reach of hearing disabilities, beyond the aging population.</p>
